# Scorpia-Pixel

Hey there! Scorpia-Pixel is my personal sandbox for learning image-processing in Python.
If you just want to flip colors or blur a photo for fun, youâ€™re in the right place.
If you need millisecond-level performance for productionâ€¦ probably look elsewhere (for now ðŸ˜‰).


## Why I built it

I learn best by doing, so I started hacking together tiny filtersâ€”first an RGB invert, then a box blur, and the rabbit hole just kept going.
Publishing the code on PyPI felt like the perfect excuse to practise packaging, testing, and documentation.
Youâ€™re welcome to poke around, break things, and tell me what I did wrongâ€”friendly bug reports are gold.

## What it can do today

* Invert colors: turn a picture into its photo-negative twin.
* Blur images: box blur, Gaussian blur â€“ soften edges with your choice of kernel.
* Simple I/O helpers: load_image() and save_image() so you donâ€™t have to remember Pillowâ€™s API.
Planned (in no particular order):

Sobel / edge detection
Fancy CLI with progress bars
GPU acceleration (one dayâ€¦)


## Installation

#### The easy way
pip install scorpia-pixel

#### Or, if you enjoy living on the bleeding edge:
git clone https://github.com/Montasar-Dridi/scorpia-pixel.git \
cd scorpia-pixel \
pip install .

    
## Demo
```
from pixel_core import load_image, save_image, blur_image, invert_colors

# 1. Load an image
img = load_image("input.png")

# 2. Apply filters
blurred = blur_image(img, kernel_size=5)
negative = invert_colors(img)

# 3. Save the results
save_image(blurred, "output/blurred.png")
save_image(negative, "output/negative.png")
```
